        <h2>Welcome to Neon Game Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          We list games and game reviews submitted by members of our community.
          Mostly these are the solid classic games but reviewing and discussing
          any game is welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're currently thinking of further way to expand our site. We have
          been considering adding game specific forums, mod lists, mod
          communities etc.
