# Week 07 assignment

## Instructions

Creating and maintaining applications that submit and retrieve information from a database is a fundamental part of web development. Many of the websites and apps we use every day—such as Facebook, Instagram, WordPress, Trello, Moodle, banking apps, Eventbrite, and various fitness-tracking tools—are, at their core, database-driven applications.

Over the next few weeks, you will be tasked with creating a series of database-driven apps with increasing levels of complexity and functionality. You have the freedom to interpret this task in a way that suits your interests and creativity. Whether you choose to build a blog, a recipe-sharing platform, a book/movie/TV tracker, a habit tracker, a sports discussion board, or any other application idea you have, the goal is to apply the concepts you’ve learned and solidify your understanding of how data can be stored, retrieved and manipulated within web applications.

## Requirements

    🎯 Create a client using React.
    🎯 Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
    🎯 Build a React form for users to create posts.
    🎯 Create multiple pages using React Router.
    🎯 Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.
    🎯 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.
    🎯 Display all posts using .map().
    🎯 Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database.
